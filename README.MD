# Compiler

A compiler for C

## Details

Just for fun I'm trying to see how decent of a C compiler I can make. It's
not going to be great, in fact it will only be passable. Hopefully I can get
an okay compiler going.

So far this is built for:
* Mac (64-bit)
* Linux (32-bit)

To switch the build, please set the ```define``` at the top of the Compile.h 
file
